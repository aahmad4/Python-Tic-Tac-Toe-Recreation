# Python-Tic-Tac-Toe-Recreation
Using the console, I made a very nicely structured tic tac toe game. The program doesn't require any further modules so it's readily available to use by anyone at any time. Simply download my pythonTicTacToeGame.py file. 

# How To Play
Upon downloading my .py file, compile the program and the game will have begun. It will be you vs another player and you get to choose whether or not you want to use X or O as your game piece. The first player to get three in a row is declared the winner. Good luck!
