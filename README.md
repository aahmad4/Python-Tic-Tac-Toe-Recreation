<h1 align="center">Tic Tac Toe</h1> 

<p align="center">
Using the console, I made a very nicely structured Tic Tac Toe game. The program doesn't require any external libraries or modules, so it's readily available for anyone to use at anytime!

## Rules
Compile the program and the game will have begun. It will be you vs another player and you get to choose whether or not you want to use X or O as your game piece. The first player to get three in a row is declared the winner. Good luck!
